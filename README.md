# Data Science Portfolio


Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self-learning purposes. Presented in the form R markdown files published at RPubs.


- ### Data Analysis & Visualization with R
   - [Black Friday |  Analytics Vidhya ](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/454168) : Predicting sales based on cutomer attribute. Data was retrieved from Analytics Vidhya as a practice problem. Extensive EDA with Linear Regression and Decision Trees machine learning algorithms.
   - [Moneyball | Seanlehman.com](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/453841) : Replacing lost players as an Auckland A's Manager. Used linear programming to narrow down the best replacements.
   - [Corruption and Human Development | The Economist](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/453686) : Replicating the "Corrosive corruption" article's graph released by the Economist in 2011, plotting the Human Development Index against the Corruption Perception Index.
  
  


- ### Machine Learning with R
  - [Linear Regression : Bike Sharing Demand | Kaggle](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450898): Predicting the total count of bikes rented during each hour using only information available prior to the rental period. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis and discovering linear regression's low performance for time-series and non-linear data. 
  - [Logistic Regression : Adult Salary | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450142) : Predicting the salary class of adults in the dataset, either making <=50k or >50k per year. Extensive cleaning of data to prepare for analysis.
  - [K Nearest Neighbors : Iris | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450973) : A simple cluseting approahch using a very famous dataset.  
  - [K Means Clustering : Wine | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450046) : Unsupervised learning technique applied to a famous dataset with labels to observe its performance. 
  - [Support Vector Machine : Lending | Lendingclub](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450085) : Using publicly available lending data from 2007-2010 to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. Takes advantage of the kernel trick with SVM and tunes the parameters accordingly to achieve the best results.
  - [Decision Trees & Random Forest : College | ISLR](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/451869) : Exploring tree methods to classify schools as private or public status based off their features. The gini coefficient is presented in random forest analysis to get a grasp on the extent the features contributed to the split. 
  - [Neural Network : Bank Authentication | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/451463) : Use of neural network algorithm to estimate whether the bank notes were authentic or fake. The dataset contain information of wavelet transformation, which roughly translates to the change in frequency of signals when there is a high-contrast in colors of the image. Random Forest is also conducted to legitimize the Neural Network's perfect result. 
  - [Natural Language Processing : Word Cloud | Twiitter](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/451880) : Connecting and importing real-time data from twitter to form a wordcloud. A follow-along exercise to uderstand how NLP works in R.
