# Data Science Portfolio


A repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self-learning purposes. Presented in the form R markdown files published at RPubs.


- ### Data Analysis & Visualization with R
   - [Culture Chart | Hofstede ](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/490210): Hierarchial clustering of countries based on culture and its dendrogram. Fascinating to see the top 5 Happiest countries ranked by the Hapiness Research Institute to be clustered together!
   - [Black Friday |  Analytics Vidhya ](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/454168): Predicting sales based on customer attribute. The analysis includes Extensive EDA with Linear Regression and Decision Trees machine learning algorithms.
   - [Moneyball | Seanlahaman.com](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/453841): Replacing lost key players as an Auckland A's Manager. Used linear programming pacakge (lpSolve) to narrow down the best replacements.
   - [Corruption and Human Development | The Economist](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/453686): Replicating the "Corrosive corruption" article's graph released by the Economist in 2011, plotting the Human Development Index against the Corruption Perception Index.
  
  


- ### Machine Learning with R
  - [Linear Regression: Bike Sharing Demand | Kaggle](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450898): Predicting the total count of bikes rented during each hour using only information available prior to the rental period. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis and discovering linear regression's low performance for time-series and non-linear data. 
  - [Logistic Regression: Adult Salary | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450142): Predicting the salary class of adults in the dataset, either making <=50k or >50k per year. Extensive cleaning of data to prepare for analysis.
  - [K Nearest Neighbors: Iris | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450973): A simple clustering approach using a very famous dataset.  
  - [K Means Clustering: Wine | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450046): Unsupervised learning technique applied to a famous dataset with labels to observe its performance. 
  - [Support Vector Machine: Lending | Lendingclub](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/450085): Using publicly available lending data from 2007-2010 to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. Takes advantage of the kernel trick with SVM and tunes the parameters accordingly to achieve the best results.
  - [Decision Trees & Random Forest: College | ISLR](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/451869): Exploring tree methods to classify schools as private or public status based on their features. The Gini coefficient is presented in random forest analysis to get a grasp on the extent the features contributed to the split. 
  - [Neural Network: Bank Authentication | UCI Learning Depository](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/451463): Use of neural network algorithm to estimate whether the bank notes were authentic or fake. The dataset contains information of wavelet transformation, which roughly translates to the change in frequency of signals when there is a high-contrast in colours of the image. Random Forest is also conducted to legitimise the Neural Network's perfect result. 
  - [Natural Language Processing: Word Cloud | Twiitter](http://rpubs.com/LeeJunHan/451880): Connecting and importing real-time data from Twitter to form a word cloud. A follow-along exercise to understand how NLP works in R.
